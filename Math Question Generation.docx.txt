Problem Statement
You are given the following two Math questions (Refer Base questions). Your goal is to create similar questions using LLM. 
Things to consider:
1. A question can have equations and formulas in LaTeX format, and it should be preserved.
2. A question can have images and we need to create appropriate image in the new question
Feel free to use AI editors such as cursor.ai or any of your favorites.
Expected Output
A Word document/Google doc link along with Github link to be sent in the chat. The word document should have two newly-generated questions in Question Output format (refer next section).
Question Output Format
@title Assessment title, can be a meaningful name
@description assessment description
